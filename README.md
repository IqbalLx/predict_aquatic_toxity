# QSAR Aquatic Toxicity Prediction with Neural Network Using TensorFlow

The TensorFlow Neural Network model is used to predict the level of Aqua Toxicity accurately with minimal amount of time. 
So we can speed up the process of cleaning water once we know the level of toxicity to ensure the survival of aquatic creatures.
