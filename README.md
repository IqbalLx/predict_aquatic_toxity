# QSAR Aquatic Toxicity Prediction with Neural Network Using TensorFlow

The TensorFlow Neural Network model is used to predict the level of Aqua Toxicity accurately with minimal amount of time. 
So we can speed up the process of cleaning water once we know the level of toxicity to ensure the survival of aquatic creatures.

The dataset is from UCI : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/QSAR+aquatic+toxicity# 
This dataset is used to predict acute aquatic toxicity of organic chemicals against Daphnia Magna. This data set consists of 546 organic molecules.
